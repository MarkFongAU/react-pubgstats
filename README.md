Pubgstats is a website that displays player's stats from Player's Unknown Battleground. The project is build with ReactJS and the API originates from [PUBG op.gg](https://pubg.op.gg/).

To run the application run `npm install` and `npm start` and access the web application via `http://localhost:3000`

Note: The design of the web application has only been completed, whilst I am still struggling to find a way to integrate the Express node back-end with the React app created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
